## Know budgets

The first step to budgeting is understand what a budget is. A budget is either a noun defined as "an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time" or a verb as "allow or provide a particular amount of money in a budget."

## Make it yours

When you first sign up and create an account with Budgiter you're automatically given an empty budget for you to play around with. This is to act as a playground for you to get comfortable with the how the app works. 

There's a few options available when adding a transaction to make it easier to create an extended budget to understand how your money will grow or fall from your current spending habits. 

Transactions can be categorized into four labels. Income, primary recurring, secondary recurring, and individual transctions. Ultimately, you are going to determine where each purchase or spend goes. 

Here are some ways to understand how to use these labels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Income">
    The income label is the a label that should not be left for interpretation. 
    Any sort of addition or return to your balance should be labeled as income. 
    Whether that be a paycheck, a return, or a friend paying you back. 
    This way you can quickly and easily see what is making your total balance grow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Primary recurring transactions">
    The primary recurring label is where you can determine what recurring expenses you prioritize.
    Many of the budgets provided by Budgiter will have two general criteria for primary recurring transactions, those being: shelter and credit.
    When considering priority of transactions Budgiter considers those that promote success as the highest priority.
    Credit based transactions, those being payments that get reported to credit bureaus, should be the highest priority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secondary recurring transactions">
    The secondary recurring label was added after the initial design of Budgiter to better accomodate recurring transactions that are not as important as others.
    These recurring transactions can include various subscription services that are not essential to your life or, better understood as, recurring expenses that 
    would not be included in your "minimal cost of living."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Individual transactions">
    The individual transactions can be of any priority. They can be absolutely necessary to your health or a small charitable donation.
    Similarly to the income label an individual transaction should be left for interpretation. This is a transaction that would not occur without you knowingly making that single transaction once.
    Recurring transactions are transactions that occur on schedule; individual transactions are transactions that occur once or one at a time.

## Understand the interface

Budgiter was designed to make it easy to create a **_prolonged_** budget. This can make some of the interface difficult to understand for something as simple as adding a transaction. 
However, the best way to budget for something is to prepare well ahead of time. To make up for the compromise of ease, Budgiter is providing a knowledge base with support documents on 
understanding the interfaces and is still developing and evolving to be the ultimate and easiest budgeting tool.
