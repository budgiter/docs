## Viewing budgets

To view a budget you must select it in the Budgets page then navigate to the either Home page to see an organized budget or the Transactions page to see a complete list of transactions in the budget.

To view a template, or a published budget, you must first copy it to add it to your Budgets page. Then you can select the budget as explained previously.
