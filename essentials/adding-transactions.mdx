## Adding transactions

Adding a transaction, or multiple repeated transactions, is simple but the component is rich with features that can make it look more complicated. 

### Minimum requirements to add a transaction

Only two fields are required to add a transaction: a title and amount. All of the other fields have default values. For example, 
adding a transaction titled "Dinner" with an amount of "13.07" will automatically select the "Individual transaction" label, repeat once (meaning it will not repeat more than once), 
and default to the date shown on the component.

### Fully customize transactions 

The component to add a transaction has 6 different values you can customize for a transaction to make your budget yours. Those are:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Title">
    The title, or name, of your transaction. This is one of the two required values.
    Example:
    > Dinner
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Amount">
    The amount, or total, of your transaction. This is one of the two required values.
    Example:
    > 13.07
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Date">
    The date, or time, of your transaction. If this value is empty it will default to shown date.
    Example:
    > 11/11/2022
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Label">
    The label of your transaction. There are four labels to choose from: Income, primary recurring, secondary recurring, or individual. If this value is empty it will default to an "Individual transaction" label.
    Example:
    > Primary recurring transaction
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repeat">
    This determines how often the inputted transaction repeats. This is meant to create a prolonged budget and understand long-term cash flow. If this value is empty it will default to "Once" and will not repeat more than once.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding labels

Transactions can be categorized into four labels. Income, primary recurring, secondary recurring, and individual transctions. Ultimately, you are going to determine where each purchase or spend goes. 

Here are some ways to understand how to use these labels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Income">
    The income label is the a label that should not be left for interpretation. 
    Any sort of addition or return to your balance should be labeled as income. 
    Whether that be a paycheck, a return, or a friend paying you back. 
    This way you can quickly and easily see what is making your total balance grow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Primary recurring transactions">
    The primary recurring label is where you can determine what recurring expenses you prioritize.
    Many of the budgets provided by Budgiter will have two general criteria for primary recurring transactions, those being: shelter and credit.
    When considering priority of transactions Budgiter considers those that promote success as the highest priority.
    Credit based transactions, those being payments that get reported to credit bureaus, should be the highest priority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secondary recurring transactions">
    The secondary recurring label was added after the initial design of Budgiter to better accomodate recurring transactions that are not as important as others.
    These recurring transactions can include various subscription services that are not essential to your life or, better understood as, recurring expenses that 
    would not be included in your "minimal cost of living."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Individual transactions">
    The individual transactions can be of any priority. They can be absolutely necessary to your health or a small charitable donation.
    Similarly to the income label an individual transaction should be left for interpretation. This is a transaction that would not occur without you knowingly making that single transaction once.
    Recurring transactions are transactions that occur on schedule; individual transactions are transactions that occur once or one at a time.
