## Adding transactions

Adding a transaction, or multiple repeated transactions, is simple but the component is rich with features that can make it look more complicated. 

### Minimum requirements to add a transaction

Only two fields are required to add a transaction: a title and amount. All of the other fields have default values. For example, 
adding a transaction titled "Dinner" with an amount of "13.07" will automatically select the "Individual transaction" label, repeat once (meaning it will not repeat more than once), 
and default to the date shown on the component.

### Fully customize transactions 

The component to add a transaction has 6 different values you can customize for a transaction to make your budget yours. Those are:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Title">
    The title, or name, of your transaction. This is one of the two required values.
    Example:
    > Dinner
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Amount">
    The amount, or total, of your transaction. This is one of the two required values.
    Example:
    > 13.07
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Date">
    The date, or time, of your transaction. If this value is empty it will default to shown date.
    Example:
    > 11/11/2022
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Label">
    The label of your transaction. There are four labels to choose from: Income, primary recurring, secondary recurring, or individual. If this value is empty it will default to an "Individual transaction" label.
    Example:
    > Primary recurring transaction
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repeat">
    This determines how often the inputted transaction repeats. This is meant to create a prolonged budget and understand long-term cash flow. If this value is empty it will default to "Once" and will not repeat more than once.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
