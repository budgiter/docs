## Creating budgets

There are two options when creating a budget: title and description. This is for you to create multiple budgets and be able to differentiate between them. 

The selected budget will be highlighted on the Budgets page and will also be shown on the navigation menu. 

### Visualizing success with templates

Vision budgets are a way of visualizing the finances of the life you want to live.
