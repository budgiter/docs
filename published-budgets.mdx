## Publishers

To publish a budget you must first contact Budgiter to apply to be a publisher. This is to ensure that the publisher is properly aware of how to design a budgeting template. More importantly, this is so that 
the publisher is aware that published budgets are public and viewable by everyone. 

<Info>There is a distinct difference between budgets and templates, or published budgets, not only in design but also in function. Budgets are private. Templates, published budgets, are public.</Info>

## Templates

Templates are the best way to view and understand a budget. Copying a template to one of your budgets is the easiest way to get started on making a budget. However, making a template yours may be 
a bit more difficult because how updating transactions currently works. 

<Note>Budgiter is still in early development. Templates are currently meant for comparisons as you pave your own path with your personal budgets.</Note>
