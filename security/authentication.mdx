Budgiter leverages the tools and security of our database provider to handle user authentication. Here is some more information on Budgiter's authentication from our database provider:

> Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the user's devices.

Budgiter needs an email to act as an identifier for every individual user. While Budgiter can read your email address, to identify your budgets and transactions to you, it **cannot** read your password. No one from Budgiter will ever ask you for your password.

<Tip>You can get an email to reset your password by clicking on the "Forgot password" button found in the [log in](https://app.budgiter.com/login) page.</Tip>

## Account visibility

An email address is only visible to the user account of that email address. 

However, display names are attached to templates, or published budgets, and will be visible as the author of a template if published. 

You can view and change your display name in the [profile](https://app.budgiter.com/profile) page. 

## Budget and transaction visibility

Budgets and transactions are only visible to the user account that created those budgets and transactions.

However, published budgets, or templates, and transactions associated to those templates, or published budgets, are visible to everybody.

<Tip>Only approved accounts can publish templates to ensure the publisher is adequately aware of this visibility.</Tip>
