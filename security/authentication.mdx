## Emails and passwords

Budgiter leverages the tools and security of our database provider to handle user authentication. Here is some more information on Budgiter's authentication from our database provider:

> Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the user's devices.

Budgiter needs an email to act as an identifier for every individual user. While Budgiter can read your email address, to identify your budgets and transactions to you, it **cannot** read your password. No one from Budgiter will ever ask you for your password.

<Tip>You can get an email to reset your password by clicking on the "**Forgot password**" button found in the [app log in](https://app.budgiter.com/login) page.</Tip>

## Guests

Guest authentication is currently disabled.

<Warning>Guest accounts are primarily used for testing as Budgiter is still in early development.</Warning>
