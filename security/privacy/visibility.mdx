## Account visibility

An email address is only visible to the user account of that email address. 

However, display names are attached to <Tooltip tip="published budgets">templates</Tooltip> and will be visible as the author of a template if published. 

You can view and change your display name in the [app profile](https://app.budgiter.com/profile) page. 

## Budget and transaction visibility

Budgets and transactions are only visible to the user account that created those budgets and transactions.

However <Tooltip tip="published budgets">templates</Tooltip>, and transactions associated to those <Tooltip tip="published budgets">templates</Tooltip>, are visible to everybody.

<Tip>Only approved accounts can publish templates to ensure the publisher is adequately aware of this visibility.</Tip>
