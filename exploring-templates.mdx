## Templates

Templates are the best way to view and understand a budget. Copying a template to one of your budgets is the easiest way to get started on making a budget.

Templates are currently best for comparisons as you pave your own path with your personal budgets.

Budgiter's budgeting tools empower you to imagine and explore different lifestyles. With Budgiter you do not have to budget your personal finances. You can instead create a budget with your life goals. These budgets can act as a vision board to motivate you to pursue a future worth looking forward to. 

## Publishers

To publish a budget you must first contact Budgiter to apply to be a publisher. This is to ensure that the publisher is properly aware of how to design a budgeting template. More importantly, this is so that the publisher is aware that published budgets are public and viewable by everyone.
