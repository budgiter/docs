## Overview

Budgiter's home page gives you a quick overview of your budget for the current month. There's an overview available to quickly see how your budget is doing this month at a glance and breaks down your transactions into familiar and understandable groups with self-describing labels. 

<Tip>Visualize past, present, and future by selecting different months.</Tip>

## Labels 

Transactions are grouped into labeled lists to make budgeting intuitive and understandable. Cash flow is better understood when recurring expenses are acknowledged separately from individual expenses.  

### Present balance 

The present balance shows the total balance available in your budget at today's date. 

### Income

The **Income** group allows you to see the total amount of expected income for the selected month. 

### Primary recurring transactions

The **Primary recurring transactions** group allows you to see what's left for the month after the budget's primary recurring expenses. 

### Secondary recurring transactions

The **Secondary recurring transactions** group allows you to see what's left for the month after the budget's secondary recurring expenses. 

### Individual transactions

The **Individual transactions** group allows you to see what's left for the month after the budget's individual, or separate, expenses. 

## Understanding labels

Transactions can be categorized into four labels. Income, primary recurring, secondary recurring, and individual transctions. Ultimately, you are going to determine where each purchase or spend goes. 

Here are some ways to understand how to use these labels:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Income">
    The income label is the a label that should not be left for interpretation. 
    Any sort of addition or return to your balance should be labeled as income. 
    Whether that be a paycheck, a return, or a friend paying you back. 
    This way you can quickly and easily see what is making your total balance grow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Primary recurring transactions">
    The primary recurring label is where you can determine what recurring expenses you prioritize.
    Many of the budgets provided by Budgiter will have two general criteria for primary recurring transactions, those being: shelter and credit.
    When considering priority of transactions Budgiter considers those that promote success as the highest priority.
    Credit based transactions, those being payments that get reported to credit bureaus, should be the highest priority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secondary recurring transactions">
    The secondary recurring label was added after the initial design of Budgiter to better accomodate recurring transactions that are not as important as others.
    These recurring transactions can include various subscription services that are not essential to your life or, better understood as, recurring expenses that 
    would not be included in your "minimal cost of living."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Individual transactions">
    The individual transactions can be of any priority. They can be absolutely necessary to your health or a small charitable donation.
    Similarly to the income label an individual transaction should be left for interpretation. This is a transaction that would not occur without you knowingly making that single transaction once.
    Recurring transactions are transactions that occur on schedule; individual transactions are transactions that occur once or one at a time.
