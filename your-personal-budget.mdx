## Know your journey

A budget is not an a passive tool. It is an active understanding of the flow of your cash, also known as your **_cash flow_**. How quickly you map out your budgeting journey will depend on your understanding of your expenses.

At this moment, Budgiter does not have a way of automatically reading and understanding your expenses. This means that you will need to add them yourself as you become aware of them.

For example, while you may know that rent is due on the 1st of every month you may not know about that random subscription you signed up for a while back until it pulls from your bank account.

## Paving your path

The quickest way to start a budget based on your cash balances is to start with an income transaction that matches, or equals, your current bank balance. 

The next step is to add any recurring transactions that you are aware of. How you label them, such as a primary or secondary recurring transaction, is up to you. The most important thing is 
to know that these are recurring transactions and how often they occur. Budgiter allows you automatically add recurring transactions either every monthly, weekly, or daily for a full year. 

<Tip>Add repeating transactions in January to budget a whole calendar year.</Tip>

<Warning>There is currently no easy way to update multiple transactions. If a bundled transaction, meaning multiple transactions at once using the repeat transactions option, is added incorrectly you will 
need to delete the bundled transactions all together and add it again.</Warning>

You will not always be aware of all of the recurring transactions and expenses in your life. That is why it recommended to stay vigilant about your bank balances. Comparing your current bank balance with 
Budigter's present balance is the best way to be aware of any unknown transactions or expenses. 

<Note>If your bank balance does not match Budgiter's present balance then that means there is an unknown transaction to add to your budget</Note>

<Warning>Sometimes a transaction that was previously added and budgeted will not match the actual transaction. For example, adding income as a repeating transaction but working different amount of hours or receiving a 
bonus that was not budgeted. To resolve these discrepancies you will need to update that existing budgeted transaction with the actual transaction.</Warning>

Make sure you add individual transactions as you spend to keep your budget up-to-date.

## Awareness of diligence 

Budgiter is still in early development which means a lot of the work involved is still dependent on you, the user. This provides an opportunity for you to better understand your budgeting journey 
by staying becoming more aware of the value of each transaction.
